# ROADMAP


### PRODUCTION READY

A big `NO` now. 

### TOOLS
1. Java
2. SpringBoot

PS: I am using these tools for the first time myself(including the language) 
to explore and test them, and see how far I can push them.

### DESIGN

1. Microservices Architecture for Scalability and Fault Isolation.
2. Rate limiting to handle high concurrency fairly.
3. Optimistic Locking for seat reservations.
4. Retry mechansim for handling optimistic locking failures.
5. Transactional operations for data consistency.
6. Async notifications.
... more to add as I think about it more.


### IN-PROGRESS
1. API Gateway for request handling and load balancing.

### DONE
Nothing so far.
